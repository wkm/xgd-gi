xGD-GI 0.0.1-04102004


INSTALL: xGD-GI Release 0.0.1 April 10, 2004

These are not auto generated instructions :)

From this directory, execute the following commands:

  cd libs
  make libraries
	cd ..
  make test
  ./xgi_test

At this point you see a window with 4 colors and some text on the top.
Hit ctrl+c in the console and then modify the file "tester.c" to your
hearts content. I suggest you visit [ xgd-gi.sourceforge.net/tutorials.htm ]
first but xGD-GI is simple enough that reading the test source should be
plenty.

Please report any bugs to xgi_leaddev@sourceforge.net .
