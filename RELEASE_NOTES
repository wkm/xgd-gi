Release Notes for xGD-gi-0.0.1 released on April 8, 2004

1) Introduction
   This is the first release of the xGD Graphical Interfacer. Note that, for
   all points and purposes, this is a technology preview.
   
   For a tutorial on xGD please see "~/dir/to/xgd-gi/libs/tutorial.html"
  


2) Core Additions/Modifications
   The "core" of xGD-GI allows for creating an unlimited number of windows
   and widgets. Windows can have specified positions and sizes however,
   while they do get a title, they do not have any buttons (i.e. a close
   window button does not exist). To terminate a program either hit C+c or
   (if you use Enlightenment, like me) right click the title bar and click
   either "close" or "annihilate".
   
   In addition, a widget can not be "clickable", that is, there is no
   clicked callback. And it is not possible to change a widget's properties
   (more from laziness than anything else).
   
   Also the "destroy" window function has not been implemented.



3) Widget Additions/Modifications
   Only the following two widgets are supported:
   
   Colorbox: widget that defines a box by a point at the upperleft of the
   	box and a x and y size. The color is specified by either using one
	of the default colors (white, black, grey, red, green, blue) or by
	manual entry of three floats for red, green, and blue (ala glColor3f);
	
   Simpletext: widget that displays a unformatted string of charecters at a
        given point on the screen. The color is the last on used (you can work
	around this by using glColor3f(red_color, green_color, blue_color) to
	specify a color before calling xgiMainLoop(). Also, the default color
	(on my computer, but I think on all computers in general) is white.
